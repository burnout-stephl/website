 <h1> This is a really ugly web-site </h1>
  
 <h2> Paragraph 1 </h2>
 <p> the p tag defines a paragraph and so i have to write a little bit of useless text in order to check what the tag really does. Hmmm. what else should i write? I don't really know actually... Mabe I should try to include a link in here. It is the link to the casati webcam at langenfrener: <a href="https://tl.scenaridigitali.com/cevedale/images/cevedale.jpg" target="_blank">Casati Webcam</a>. </p>
 
 <h2> Paragraph 2 </h2>
 <p> so lets insert another paragraph and see what it looks like... Here i include a little pic </p> 
 
 <img src="title.JPG" alt="hi" class="inline" height="100" width="100" />
